After completing a graduate program at GE Power, I joined the GE Healthcare service team where I actively contributed to the digital transformation of the Service team.

### Where I Was

I was part of the service team for the [mammography modality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography), based in Buc, working within an [Agile environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

### What I Did

As the leader of the service team's digitalization initiatives, I led various projects aimed at service digitalization. These projects included implementing **predictive maintenance**, enhancing databases, and creating **automated tools** to drive cost reduction initiatives. This role provided me with a comprehensive understanding of data processes, spanning from system-level considerations to data collection, pipelines, database management, modeling, and data analysis.

#### Predictive Maintenance

Predictive maintenance involves assessing equipment conditions through regular or continuous monitoring. The goal is to perform maintenance at the most cost-effective time before equipment performance degrades beyond a threshold. This approach minimizes unplanned downtime, benefiting both customers and suppliers:

- Customers experience reduced unplanned downtime, increasing machine utilization time.
- Suppliers cut costs by targeting specific issues, reducing unnecessary part replacements.
- Strong data quality is crucial for predictive maintenance. Models like linear regressions and neural networks can be developed to detect and prevent early failures with dedicated data infrastructure.

#### Databases Enhancement

Since predictive maintenance relies on high-quality data, it's vital to develop data collection from sensors, databases, and infrastructure for parallel data collection and analysis alongside predictive maintenance model development. In my role, I contributed to developing new logs, databases, and monitoring techniques.

I worked with both **SQL** databases (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle) and **NoSQL** databases (MongoDB). I also created Python scripts for data collection and analysis, as well as used Spoon for pipelines and transformations. I managed data from end to end, from the system to the engineers using the data for project enhancement.

#### Automated Tools for Cost Calculations

With the influx of data and changing parameters, understanding which models can impact costs and service efficiency becomes challenging. To aid decision-makers in setting priorities, I developed **automated tools for cost calculations**. I built a Python tool based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify and categorize costs, helping prioritize actions based on service data. Results were visualized using Sisense.

### What I Learned

From a technical standpoint, I gained proficiency in **Python** and deepened my knowledge of databases. Working in an Agile environment also exposed me to new working methodologies.
